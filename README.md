### 🛠️ Production-Ready Systems

I build things that solve hard problems. My sweet spot is taking powerful but complex technologies - constraint solvers, AI runtimes, optimization engines - and turning them into systems that actually work in production. Python and Rust are my tools of choice.

- **AI**: Optimization, Constraint Programming, ML, Agents
- **End-to-end Systems**: Rust, Ruby, Python, JavaScript
- **Cloud**: Serverless architectures
