### 🛠️ Production-Ready Systems
I engineer systems bridging AI agents and algorithmic tools!
- **AI Agents**: Production implementations (LlamaIndex/LangChain)
- **AI Optimization**: Constraint solving (BlackOps Solver, Timefold, OR-Tools)
- **Backend Systems**: Python, Rust, Go
- **Cloud Automation**: AWS serverless architectures

### 🚀 Highlighted Projects

#### Lead Maintainer for [SolverForge](https://github.com/SolverForge)
`Constraint Solving` `Open Source`
> Currently providing **community support** in the form of [solverforge-legacy](https://github.com/SolverForge/solverforge-legacy) following the [discontinuation of the Python solver](https://github.com/TimefoldAI/timefold-solver/discussions/1698) by the Timefold team.

> [Roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/SolverForge/discussions/1)

#### [Yuga Planner](https://github.com/blackopsrepl/yuga-planner) 
`Gradio` `LlamaIndex` `Timefold` `MCP`
> Neuro-symbolic scheduling system that breaks down tasks and optimizes team allocation. Developed for Hugging Face's 2025 AI Agent Hackathon.

#### Timefold Python Contribution 
`Constraint Solving` `Open Source`
> Ported meeting scheduling quickstart from Java to Python ([merged upstream](https://github.com/TimefoldAI/timefold-quickstarts))

> Optimized data models for the vehicle routing and meeting scheduling problems, with [benchmarks](https://github.com/blackopsrepl/timefold-quickstarts-python/blob/main/benchmarks/report.md) showing near-Java performance

#### OCR Attendance System 
`AWS` `Computer Vision`
> Production system with 99.8% accuracy rate for events attendance tracking

### 💡 Core Principles
1. **No-BS Approach**: Solve real problems - ignore hype
2. **Certified Skills**: ML, Data Engineering, AWS
3. **Polyglot Flexibility**: EN/IT/DE/FR + right tool for the job (Python/Rust/Go)
4. **EU-Compliant Automation**: Privacy-aware implementations

---

### 🌱 Currently Upskilling
- Hybrid LLM + solver architectures
- Cross-language type conversion
- Native Rust-Java bytecode translation optimization
