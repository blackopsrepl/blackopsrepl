### 🛠️ Production-Ready Systems

I build things that solve hard problems. My sweet spot is taking powerful but complex technologies - constraint solvers, AI runtimes, optimization engines - and turning them into systems that actually work in production. Python and Rust are my tools of choice.

- **PlanningAI**: Optimization, Constraint solving (SolverForge, Timefold), Agents (LLamaIndex)
- **Backend Systems**: Rust, Python, some Java and some Go
- **Cloud Automation**: AWS serverless architectures
