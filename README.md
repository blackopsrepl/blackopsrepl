### 🛠️ Production-Ready Systems
I engineer systems bridging AI agents and algorithmic tools!
- **AI Optimization**: Constraint solving (SolverForge, Timefold)
- **AI Agents**: Production implementations (LlamaIndex/LangChain or in Rust)
- **Backend Systems**: Python, Rust, Go
- **Cloud Automation**: AWS serverless architectures

### 🚀 Highlighted Projects

#### Lead Maintainer for [SolverForge](https://github.com/SolverForge)
`Constraint Solving` `Open Source`
> Currently providing **community support** in the form of [solverforge-legacy](https://github.com/SolverForge/solverforge-legacy) following the [discontinuation of the Python solver](https://github.com/TimefoldAI/timefold-solver/discussions/1698) by the Timefold team.

#### [Yuga Planner](https://github.com/blackopsrepl/yuga-planner) 
`Gradio` `LlamaIndex` `Timefold` `MCP`
> Neuro-symbolic scheduling system that breaks down tasks and optimizes team allocation. Developed for Hugging Face's 2025 AI Agent Hackathon.

#### Timefold Python Contribution 
`Constraint Solving` `Open Source`
> Ported meeting scheduling quickstart from Java to Python ([merged upstream](https://github.com/TimefoldAI/timefold-quickstarts))

> Optimized data models for the vehicle routing and meeting scheduling problems, with [benchmarks](https://github.com/blackopsrepl/timefold-quickstarts-python/blob/main/benchmarks/report.md) showing near-Java performance

#### OCR Attendance System 
`AWS` `Computer Vision`
> Production system with 99.8% accuracy rate for events attendance tracking
